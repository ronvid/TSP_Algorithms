# Experimental analysis of traveling salesman algorithms for cubic graphs
This repository holds the code used in my Bachelors thesis.
This includes an implementation of Eppstein's and Schuster's algorithms as well as the described heuristics.
This repository additionaly includes python files for visualising, however these need to be configured within the file, based on which tests shall be visualized.
